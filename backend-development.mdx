  **Prerequisite** You should have Python 3 correctly insalled.

### The Stack

The Zeeno api is developed using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). It is hosted on an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance and we use [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a reverse proxy.

### Onboarding Resources

### Running the production server

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You need to have access to our AWS EC2 instance.
</Info>

Use this when you want to check real-time traffic or when you need to make changes to the production instance. Before making any changes on the production test them on a seperate EC2 instance and locally first.

Step 1. SSH into the AWS EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh -i "zeeno_key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-34-218-116-78.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

Step 2. Install the requirements (do this only the first time):

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Step 3. Start the server locally:

```bash
python3 -m uvicorn main:app
```
By default the server will run on port 8000.


### Running the server locally

Use this when testing the server locally after eg. generating new api endpoints or changing existing endpoints.

Step 1. Clone the [GitHUb repo](https://github.com/42enrique/zeeno-api)

Step 2. Navigate to the `zeeno-api` directory

Step 3. Install the requirements (do this only the first time):

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 4. Install [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) (do this only the first time):

```bash
pip3 install uvicorn
```

Step 5. Start the server locally:

```bash
python3 -m uvicorn main:app
```
By default the server will run on port 8000.
