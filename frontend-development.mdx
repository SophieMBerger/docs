### The Stack

As we are building a keyboard that offers a native feel we are using Swift and SwiftUI within the Xcode IDE.

### Onboarding Resources

[Push Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter)  

[StoreKit & Managing Subscriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/)  

[Custom URL Schemas](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app)

### The current features
Our keybaord currently supports the following features:
1. Quick-Links Slingshot
2. AI KeyboardAssistantView
3. Clipboard Memory
4. Slide-To-Type 
5. Copy/Paste Shortcuts

### Getting Started
Step 1. Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/slate-labs/slate-keyboard)

Step 2. Understand the architecture by reading the below

Step 3. Build and run the XCode project and walk through the codebase 

Instead of relying on individual button views which the user interacts with, in our keyboard, we rely on coordinate mapping. This means that our keybaord consists of only one View
which registers all of the user's taps. Each of these taps is turned into coordinates, which are then mapped to the corrisponding key, and therefore the character that should be printed
is determined. In addition to this we are able to implement dynamic tap areas, whihc is the dynamic adjusting of the tap area of a key depending on its likelyhood to be tapped, by simply
adjusting the bounds of the coordinate space which gets mapped to the given key.

#### Target App & Keyboard Extension
The iOS app is split up into two components: the target app and the keyboard extension.
 The target app is where the user completes onboarding and can adjust their keyboard experience. The keyboard extension is the main component the user will be interacting with when using Slate.
 These two components communicate and share data with each other using [User Defaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults).

#### Custom URL Schema & Deep Links
We use a [Deep Linking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) to allow the keyboard extension to open the target app or any other third-party applications.

#### SwiftUI & Views
Most of the UI components of the Target app are built using SwiftUI, as this is more intuitive and recommended by Apple. You will see one View file for each screen in our app in the project hierarchy. When creating the
Preview object of the View it is important to add '.withPreviewEventTracking()' as this will allow the preview to work correctly in Xcode.

#### `IAPManager`
This file manages all of the data transfer related with user subscriptions to the app using [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/).

#### Tracking
We use [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) in order to track our user's behaviour. In order to improve the efficiency of the tracking we have created a 'TrackingEngine' that is
used to track any events in the code.

#### Autocorrect
##### Current Approach
In order to perform autocorrection we use the `rangeOfMisspelledWord(in:range:startingAt:wrap:language:)` method in order to get the starting index of the first misspelled
 word in the given range. After tha we use the `guesses(forWordRange:in:language:)` method in order to generate a list of possible guesses for correct words. 
 We then substitute the first of these words into the [textDocumentProxy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiinputviewcontroller/1618193-textdocumentproxy) using the native methods. 
##### Current Development
The above autocorrect approach is not very accurate as it does not take into account the context of what the user is typing. As such, developing our own ML solution for autocorrect
is one of the main projects we are currently working on. All of this is documented in our [Notion workspace](https://www.notion.so/slate-hq/Slate-Team-HQ-a9a2d3e1ca5c449ea36613c39519ff36).

## Debugging the Custom Keyboard Extension

Sadly we cannot use the XCode debugger to debug issues with the custom keyboard extension. Instead Follow the below steps:

Step 1. Connect the device you are using to run the app to your laptop with a cable.

Step 2. Open up the `Console` app on your laptop.

Step 3. In the left sidebar click on your iOS device and select "start streaming" on the main screen.

Step 4. Add `import os.log` to the file you want to debug.

Step 5. Use `os_log("DEBUG STATEMENT")` in order to add debug statements throughout your code.

Step 6. Run the XCode project on the connected device and go back to the `Console` app on your laptop.

Step 7. In the search field in the top right corder enter the debug statement you logged in your code to filter for it.
