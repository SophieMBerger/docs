## The Stack

As we are building a keyboard that offers a native feel we are using Swift and SwiftUI within the Xcode IDE.

## Onboarding Resources

[Push Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter)  

[StoreKit & Managing Subscriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/)  

[Custom URL Schemas](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app)

## The current features
Our keyboard currently supports the following features:
**1. Quick-Links Slingshot:** This feature allows the user to save links inside the main app and then slide from the toolbar of the keybaord to insert these links (like a slingshot)
**2. AI KeyboardAssistantView:** THis allows the user to chat with ChatGPT. When inside an Email app it will be optimized to write emails and when inside the LinkedIn app it will
be optimized to write a LinkedIn post.
**3. Clipboard Memory:** THis allows the user to save more than one item to their clipboard. It can be accessed through the assistant view.
**4. Slide-To-Type:** Here the user can slide on a predicted sentence in the toolbar of the keybaord, after they have typed at least 20 characters
**5. Copy/Paste Shortcuts:** THis allows the user to copy text using 'shift+c' and paste text using 'shift+v'

## Getting Started
Step 1. Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/slate-labs/slate-keyboard)

Step 2. Understand the architecture by reading the below

Step 3. Build and run the XCode project and walk through the codebase 

## Our Architecture

Instead of relying on individual button views which the user interacts with, in our keyboard, we rely on coordinate mapping. This means that our keyboard consists of only one View
which registers all of the user's taps. Each of these taps is turned into coordinates, which are then mapped to the corrisponding key, and therefore the character that should be printed
is determined. In addition to this we are able to implement dynamic tap areas, whihc is the dynamic adjusting of the tap area of a key depending on its likelyhood to be tapped, by simply
adjusting the bounds of the coordinate space which gets mapped to the given key.

We use the MVVM architecture, therefore our application is split up into Views and Models. This can clearly be seen when looking at the file structure of our XCode project.
The Models are there to perform any data handling and computations, while the Views simply display the data contained int he Models. We only have one ViewController, which is the 
'CustomKeyboardViewController' and this handles the coordinate matching explained above, as well as other some other keyboard interactions.

### Target App & Keyboard Extension
The iOS app is split up into two components: the target app and the keyboard extension.
 The target app is where the user completes onboarding and can adjust their keyboard experience. The keyboard extension is the main component the user will be interacting with when using Slate.
 These two components communicate and share data with each other using [User Defaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults).

### Custom URL Schema & Deep Links
We use a [Deep Linking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) to allow the keyboard extension to open the target app or any other third-party applications.
More details on the implementation of this can be found inside the 'Navigation' folder inside the XCode project.

### SwiftUI & Views
Most of the UI components of the Target app are built using SwiftUI, as this is more intuitive and recommended by Apple. You will see one View file for each screen in our app in the project hierarchy. When creating the
Preview object of the View it is important to add '.withPreviewEventTracking()' as this will allow the preview to work correctly in Xcode.

### `IAPManager`
This file manages all of the data transfer related with user subscriptions to the app using [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/).

### Tracking
We use [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) in order to track our user's behaviour. In order to improve the efficiency of the tracking we have created a 'TrackingEngine' that is
used to track any events in the code.

## Debugging the Custom Keyboard Extension

If you are having issues using the XCode debugger to debug the custom keyboard extension. Instead Follow the below steps:

Step 1. Connect the device you are using to run the app to your laptop with a cable.

Step 2. Open up the `Console` app on your laptop.

Step 3. In the left sidebar click on your iOS device and select "start streaming" on the main screen.

Step 4. Add `import os.log` to the file you want to debug.

Step 5. Use `os_log("DEBUG STATEMENT")` in order to add debug statements throughout your code.

Step 6. Run the XCode project on the connected device and go back to the `Console` app on your laptop.

Step 7. In the search field in the top right corder enter the debug statement you logged in your code to filter for it.
