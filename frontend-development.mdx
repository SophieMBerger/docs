### The Stack

As we are building a keyboard that offers a native feel we are using Swift and SwiftUI within the Xcode IDE.

### Onboarding Resources

[Push Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter)  

[StoreKit & Managing Subscriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/)  

[Custom URL Schemas](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app)

### Getting Started
Step 1. Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/42enrique/ai-keyboard)

Step 2 Understand the architecture:

#### Target App & Keyboard Extension
The iOS app is split up into two components: the target app and the keyboard extension.
 The target app is where the user completes onbaording and can adjust their keyboard experience. The keyboard extension is the main component the user will be interacting with when using Slate.
 These two components communicate and share data with each other using [User Defaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults).

#### Custom URL Schema & Deep Links
We use a [custom url schema](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) to allow the keyboard extension to open the target app.
 The url schema is `slate` and the identifier is `com.slate.ai`.


#### SwiftUI & Views
Most of the UI components of the Target app are built using SwiftUI, as this is more intuitive and recommended by Apple. You will see one View file for each screen in our app in the project hierarchy.
 When it comes to the keyboard extension we are restricted to using Swift for all developement as we are using the [Fleksy SDK](https://docs.fleksy.com/) to configure the custom keyboard.

#### Notifications Managers
You will see two files in the project hierarchy that are called `NotificationsManager`. These two files handle all of the data transfer connected with scheduling and sending the user push notifications.
 Two files exist (one for the target app, the other for the keyboard extension) as each file can only have Target Membership in one of these components due to reliance on other
  files that can only be part of one component.

#### `IAPManager`
This file manages all of the data transfer related with user subscriptions to the app using [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/).

### Apple Native Autocorrect & Text Prediction
We have decided to implement Apples native autocorrect & text prediction using [UITextChecker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextchecker) on top of Fleksy's
 offering as this has been more accurate.

<Info>
  **Thesere is some very intricate cursor movement and updating of the contents of the `textDocumentProxy` which occurs as part of this implementation.
</Info>

#### Autocorrect
In order to perform autocorrection we use the `rangeOfMisspelledWord(in:range:startingAt:wrap:language:)` method in order to get the starting index of the first misspelled
 word in the given range. After tha we use the `guesses(forWordRange:in:language:)` method in order to generate a list of possible guesses for correct words. 
 We then substitute the first of these words into the [textDocumentProxy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiinputviewcontroller/1618193-textdocumentproxy) using the native methods. 

#### Text Prediction
For normal keyboard use we implemented the text prediction inside of the `TextPredictionSuggestionsFrameView`, however, we are unable to use the same view when 
inside the `KeyboardAssistantView` as only one Fleksy [FrameView](https://docs.fleksy.com/sdk-android/api-reference-android/panelhelper/) can be open at a given time. 
Hence we simply implemented the sub-views of the `TextPredictionSuggestionsFrameView` directly into the `KeyboardAssistantView`.

The `FrameView` consists of three components: the original word the user typed, the first predicted word, and the second predicted word. These predicted words are generated 
using the `completions(forPartialWordRange:in:language:)` method of the `UITextChecker`.

When the user selects the original word this word will be added to the internal dictionary as a new custom-word using the `learnWord(_:)` method of the `UITextChecker`.
